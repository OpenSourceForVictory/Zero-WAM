# Installation

## Zero-WAM Environment

The tested environment uses Python 3.10, PyTorch 2.9.0, and CUDA 12.6.

```bash
python -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
python -m pip install \
  torch==2.9.0 \
  torchvision==0.24.0 \
  torchaudio==2.9.0 \
  --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu126
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt --no-build-isolation
```

The post-training dependencies, including LeRobot 0.3.3, are included in
`requirements.txt`.

## Robotwin Environment

Robotwin evaluation requires a separate Robotwin 2.0 environment. The server
and client may use different Python environments and machines. See
[remote RoboTwin deployment](docs/ascend/REMOTE_ROBOTWIN.md) for an NVIDIA
simulation client connected to an Ascend inference server.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RoboTwin-Platform/RoboTwin.git Robotwin
cd Robotwin
git checkout 2eeec322
```

Install the Vulkan packages and Robotwin dependencies, then download the
Robotwin assets by following the official installation guide:

https://robotwin-platform.github.io/doc/usage/robotwin-install.html

Set the repository location before running an evaluation client:

```bash
export ROBOTWIN_ROOT=/path/to/your/Robotwin
```

## Zero-WAM Evaluation Protocol

To more appropriately assess generalization to unseen tasks, we revise the
success criteria for `move_stapler_pad` and `stamp_seal`:

- `move_stapler_pad`: success requires a released stapler to contact and lie within the pad area, regardless of yaw.
- `stamp_seal`: the target-plane position tolerance is increased from `1 cm` to `3 cm`.

After completing the standard Robotwin installation, back up the two upstream
task files and copy the Zero-WAM versions into the Robotwin environment:

```bash
cp -n "${ROBOTWIN_ROOT}/envs/move_stapler_pad.py" "${ROBOTWIN_ROOT}/envs/move_stapler_pad.py.upstream"
cp -n "${ROBOTWIN_ROOT}/envs/stamp_seal.py" "${ROBOTWIN_ROOT}/envs/stamp_seal.py.upstream"
cp /path/to/Zero-WAM/evaluation/robotwin/envs/move_stapler_pad.py "${ROBOTWIN_ROOT}/envs/move_stapler_pad.py"
cp /path/to/Zero-WAM/evaluation/robotwin/envs/stamp_seal.py "${ROBOTWIN_ROOT}/envs/stamp_seal.py"
```

The `.upstream` files preserve the original success criteria used for the
standard in-domain Robotwin evaluation of these two tasks.

See `README.md` for the training and evaluation commands.
